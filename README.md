## Installation

We're using gulp for this so start with
```javascript
	npm install -g gulp
```
followed by:
```javascript
	npm install
``` 
to install other dependancies.

Now just run:
```javascript
gulp
```
 in your local folder, and everything will be set up.
Changing & saving files in src folder automatically triggers jade compilation.
```
Small tip, adding or deleting files does not trigger instantenous update on the html files, 
so to fight that, just add/delete a line in any of the files in src folder to trigger the update
```
